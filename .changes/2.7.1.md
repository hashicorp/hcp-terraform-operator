## 2.7.1 (December 04, 2024)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* `Helm Chart`: The `customCAcertificates` value has been replaced to accept a base64-encoded CA bundle instead of a file path. This change aims to simplify the installation/upgrade workflow. [[GH-516](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/516)]

NOTES:

* `Helm Chart`: The default value of `operator.syncPeriod` has changed from 5 minutes to 1 hour to reduce unnecessary reconciliation. [[GH-512](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/512)]

BUG FIXES:

* `Workspace`: Fix an issue where `spec.agentPool` can be set even when `spec.executionMode` is not set to `agent`. [[GH-504](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/504)]
* `Helm Chart`: Fix an issue that prevented custom CA certificates from being attached to the pod volume. The `customCAcertificates` value now refers to a base64-encoded CRT bundle instead of a file path. [[GH-516](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/516)]

ENHANCEMENTS:

* `Helm Chart`: Add the ability to configure `affinity` and `tolerations` for the Deployment of the operator. [[GH-495](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/495)]
* `Helm Chart`: Add the ability to configure additional labels for the Operator pod. [[GH-522](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/522)]
