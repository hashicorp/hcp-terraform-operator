## 2.4.1 (June 07, 2024)

NOTES:

* In upcoming releases, we shall proceed with renaming this project to HCP Terraform Operator for Kubernetes or simply HCP Terraform Operator. This measure is necessary in response to the recent announcement of [The Infrastructure Cloud](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/introducing-the-infrastructure-cloud). The most noticeable change you can expect in version 2.6.0 is the renaming of this repository and related resources, such as the Helm chart and Docker Hub names. Please follow the changelogs for updates.

BUG FIXES:

* `Module`: Fix an issue where the controller cannot create ConfigMap and Secret for outputs when a Module custom resource `metadata.name` is longer than 63 characters. This issue occurs because the controller uses the custom resource name as the value for the ModuleName label in ConfigMap and Secret. The `ModuleName` label has been removed." [[GH-423](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cloud-operator/pull/423)]
* `Workspace`: Fix an issue where the controller cannot create ConfigMap and Secret for outputs when a Workspace custom resource `metadata.name` is longer than 63 characters. This issue occurs because the controller uses the custom resource name as the value for the `workspaceName` label in ConfigMap and Secret. The `workspaceName` label has been removed.

* Bump `github.com/hashicorp/go-tfe` from 1.49.0 to 1.55.0. [[GH-422](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cloud-operator/pull/422)]
