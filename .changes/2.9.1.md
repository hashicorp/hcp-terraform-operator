## 2.9.1 (May 14, 2025)

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed an issue where the operator could not connect to the HCP Terraform / TFE instance when using the UBI-based image due to a TLS validation error. The previous workaround required setting the `TFC_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY` environment variable to `true` in the Deployment. [[GH-600](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/600)]

ENHANCEMENTS:

* `Helm Chart`: Add the ability to configure environment variables for the Operator Deployment via `operator.env`. [[GH-601](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/601)]

DEPENDENCIES:

* Bump `kube-rbac-proxy` from 0.19.0 to 0.19.1. [[GH-599](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/599)]
