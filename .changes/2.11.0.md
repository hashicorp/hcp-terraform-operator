## 2.11.0 (December 18, 2025)

BUG FIXES:

* `Workspace`: Fix an issue when Remote State Sharing was incorrectly handled and validated. It now correctly defaults to disabled when `spec.remoteStateSharing` is omitted, and no longer fails validation when `spec.remoteStateSharing.allWorkspaces` is set to `false` without specifying workspaces. [[GH-673](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/673)]
* `AgentToken`: Fix an issue where the controller did not remove all managed tokens from the agent pool when the AgentToken custom resource was deleted. The operator now correctly cleans up all generated tokens during AgentToken deletion. [[GH-681](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/681)]
* `AgentPool`: Fix an issue where the agent pool controller panics during token deletion. The panic occurred when a CR with multiple managed tokens was marked for deletion and the deletion policy was set to `destroy`. The controller now handles this scenario correctly. [[GH-680](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/680)]

ENHANCEMENTS:

* `AgentPool`: Agent autoscaling has been updated to include speculative (plan-only) runs when determining the desired agent count. [[GH-664](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/664)]
