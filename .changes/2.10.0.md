## 2.10.0 (November 12, 2025)

NOTES:

* `RunsCollector`: Add new Prometheus-compatible metrics `hcp_tf_runs` and `hcp_tf_runs_total` to collect pending runs by status and the total number of pending runs, respectively. These metrics are in the alpha stage and subject to change. [[GH-637](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/637)]

BUG FIXES:

* `Workspace`: Fix an issue where sensitive Terraform or Environment variables are not updated when their sensitivity changes. [[GH-629](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/629)]
* `AgentPool`: Exclude runs awaiting user interaction from scaling to prevent agents from being kept unnecessarily active. [[GH-618](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/618)]
* `AgentPool`: Fix version parsing for Terraform Enterprise version format changes. [[GH-641](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/641)]

FEATURES:

* `RunsCollector`: Introduce a new controller that scrapes HCP Terraform run statuses from a specified Agent Pool and exposes them as Prometheus-compatible metrics. [[GH-637](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/637)]
* `AgentToken`: Introduce a new controller that manages tokens in arbitrary agent pools. [[GH-628](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/628)]

ENHANCEMENTS:

* `Controllers`: Add a new annotation, `app.terraform.io/paused`, to pause reconciliation for a specific CR. [[GH-631](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/631)]
* `AgentPool`: Update Kubernetes Secret synchronization to perform batch updates at the end of agent token reconciliation, reducing API calls and preventing race conditions. [[GH-650](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-terraform-operator/pull/650)]
