kind: BUG FIXES
body: '`Workspace`: Fix an issue where the controller cannot create ConfigMap and Secret for outputs when a Workspace custom resource `metadata.name` is longer than 63 characters. This issue occurs because the controller uses the custom resource name as the value for the `workspaceName` label in ConfigMap and Secret. The `workspaceName` label has been removed.'
