kind: NOTES
body: In upcoming releases, we shall proceed with renaming this project to HCP Terraform
  Operator for Kubernetes or simply HCP Terraform Operator. This measure is necessary
  in response to the recent announcement of [The Infrastructure Cloud](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/introducing-the-infrastructure-cloud).
  The most noticeable change you can expect in version 2.6.0 is the renaming of this
  repository and related resources, such as the Helm chart and Docker Hub names. Please
  follow the changelogs for updates.
