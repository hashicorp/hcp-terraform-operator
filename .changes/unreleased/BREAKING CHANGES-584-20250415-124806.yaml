kind: BREAKING CHANGES
body: '`AgentPool`: The new field, `spec.deletionPolicy`, is set to `retain` by default, which changes the previous default controller behavior when resources are deleted. The previous behavior corresponded to the `destroy` deletion policy value. This change is considered safer in cases of accidental resource deletion, planned migration, or other scenarios involving the deletion of a custom resource.'
