# Examples

[Here](./) you can find different examples of the YAML manifests. They aim to demonstrate the usage of the different features supported by the Operator and do not seek to demonstrate all possible combinations.

All examples must be based on basic examples `*-basic.yaml`.

If you encounter any issues with examples or want to add more, please feel free to open a new issue!
