# Examples

[Here](./) you can find different examples of the YAML manifests. They aim to demonstrate the usage of the different features supported by the Operator. These examples are not comprehensive, and do not illustrate all possible configurations. 

All examples must be based on basic examples `*-basic.yaml`.

If you encounter any issues with examples or want to add more, please feel free to open a new issue!
