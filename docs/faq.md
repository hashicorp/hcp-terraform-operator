# Frequently Asked Questions

## Terminology

- **What is a Kubernetes Operator?**

  Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use of custom resources to manage applications and their components. More information is in the [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

- **What is a Kubernetes Controller?**

  In Kubernetes, controllers are control loops that watch the state of your cluster, then make or request changes where needed. Each controller tries to move the current cluster state closer to the desired state. More information is in the [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/).

- **What is a Kubernetes Custom Resource?**

  Custom resources are extensions of the Kubernetes API. More information is in the [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/).

## General Questions

- **What is the difference between versions `v1` and `v2` of the Operator?**

  The second version of the Operator was developed to address some major concerns that we encountered in the first version.

  Here is the list of major improvements in the version 2:

  - A new operator option `--namespace` allows configuration of namespaces to watch. It can be one of the following: all, single, or multiple namespaces. By default, the Operator watches all namespaces, and as your setup grows, you can have multiple deployments of the Operator to better handle the load.

  - A new operator option `--sync-period` allows configuration of the minimum frequency at which all watched resources are reconciled. This allows faster synchronization of the state between Custom Resources and Terraform Cloud.

  - The Operator manages a Terraform Cloud client for each Custom Resource. This means that a single deployment of the Operator can work across multiple Terraform Cloud organizations.

  - The Operator consists of multiple controllers that manage different Terraform Cloud resources. This provides additional flexibility, e.g. a module can be executed in a workspace that is not managed by the Operator. More details about controllers you can find in the [README](../README.md) file.

  - Each controller has the option to manage the number of workers it has. By default, each controller has 1 worker. A worker is a thread that runs the control loop for a given Custom Resource. The more workers the controller has, the more Customer Resources it can handle concurrently. This improves the Operator's performance. Please refer to the [performance FAQ section](./faq.md#performance) to better understand the pros and cons.

  - Additional technical improvements:

    - More detailed logging.

    - Controllers produce event messages for each Custom Resource.

    - Better coverage of features supported by Terraform Cloud, more information [here](./features.md).

    - Better test coverage.

    - A leaner "Distroless" container image for deployment that is built for more platforms. More information [here](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless).

- **Can a single deployment of the Operator watch single, multiple, or all namespaces?**

  Yes, a single deployment of the Operator can either watch a single namespace, multiple namespaces, or all namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster. By default, the Operator watches all namespaces. If you want to specify single or multiple namespaces, you need to pass the following option when installing or upgrading the Helm chart.

  _watch a single namespace_

  ```console
  $ helm ... --set 'operator.watchedNamespaces={red}'
  ```

  _watch multiple namespaces_

  ```console
  $ helm ... --set 'operator.watchedNamespaces={white,blue,red}'
  ```

- **What will happen if I have multiple deployments of the Operator watching the same namespace(s)?**

  Unexpected behaviour is likely when multiple deployments of the operator try to reconcile the same resource. Most likely you will notice that Customer Resource objects are constantly reconciled and this can cause constant updates of Terraform Cloud objects. For example, the `Module` controller might trigger a new run every reconciliation and because of that the Run queue could grow infinitely.

  It is definitely better to avoid such situations.

- **What do the `*-workers` options do?**

  The `*-workers` options allow configuration of the number of concurrent workers available to process changes to resources. In certain cases increasing this number can improve performance.

- **What does the `sync-period` option do?**

  The `--sync-period` option specifies the minimum frequency at which watched resources are reconciled. The synchronization period should be aligned with the number of managed Customer Resources. If the period is too low and the number of managed resources is too high, you may observe slowness in synchronization.

- **Does the Operator work with Terraform Enterprise / TFE?**

  Yes, the operator can be configured to use the custom TFE API endpoint using the [`operator.tfeAddress`](../charts/terraform-cloud-operator/README.md#values) value in the Helm chart. This value should be a valid URL including the protocol(`https://`), for the API of a Terraform Enterprise instance. Once the `operator.tfeAddress` attribute is set, the operator will no longer access the public Terraform Cloud, but rather the private Terraform Enterprise instance.

- **What can I do if the Operator cannot get a Terraform Cloud client due to a TLS certificate issue?**

  There are multiple reasons why you may observe an error message in logs that indicate an issue with a TLS certificate. The error message example: _*tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid*_

  * You have a Terraform Enterprise instance and use the TLS certificate that is signed by a Certificate Authority that is not recognized by the Operator. In this case, you can use the value `customCAcertificates` of the Helm chart to specify a Certificate Authority bundle to validate API TLS certificates.
  * You have a Terraform Enterprise instance and the TLS certificate has expired. In this case, you can use the value `operator.skipTLSVerify` of the Helm chart to skip the TLS validation. **Be aware of the potential security risks.**
  * There is a TLS proxy between the Operator and Terraform Cloud / Enterprise instance that is installed by your security team to decrypt TLS connections. In this case, you can use the value `operator.skipTLSVerify` or `customCAcertificates` of the Helm chart to skip the TLS validation or specify a Certificate Authority bundle to validate API TLS certificates, respectively. Alternatively, you could talk to your security team to add an expection to this connection.

- **What does `kube-rbac-proxy` do?**

  The `kube-rbac-proxy` is a small HTTP proxy for a single upstream, that can perform RBAC authorization against the Kubernetes API. This allows providing RBAC-based access to the operator [metrics](./metrics.md) within the Kubernetes cluster. More information is in the author's [blog post](https://www.brancz.com/2018/02/27/using-kube-rbac-proxy-to-secure-kubernetes-workloads/).

## Performance

- **How many Custom Resources can be managed by a single deployment of the Operator?**

  In theory, a single deployment of the Operator can manage thousands of resources. However, the Operator's performance depends on the number of API calls it does and the Terraform Cloud API [rate limit](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs#rate-limiting) for the token used.

  The number of API calls the Operator does depends on multiple factors:

  - The value of the `sync-period` option.

  - The values of `*-workers` options.

  - The type of the resource.

  - The Terraform Cloud features being used.

  With the default values of `sync-period` (5 minutes) and `*-workers` (1 worker per controller), we recommend managing **100 resources per token**. This number can vary based on previously mentioned factors. This number can be updated later to accommodate changes in the Terraform Cloud API.

- **What can be done to improve performance?**

  The Operator allows you to refer to Terraform Cloud resources by their name or ID. For example, the `Workspace` controller allows you to specify another workspace to use as a [Run Trigger](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-triggers).  It accepts a list of workspaces that will be triggered where each item can either be the `ID` or `Name` of the workspace. When you use a name, the Operator does an API call on each reconciliation in order to get the ID of the target Workspace. This makes configurations easier to read, but causes more API calls to be as the operator needs to figure out what the ID of workspace is from the name. 

  One way to improve performance is to use the referred object ID. In this example, by the Workspace ID. In this case, the Operator will use the ID directly without trying to resolve it.

  Here is a short example to demonstrate both options:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: app.terraform.io/v1alpha2
  kind: Workspace
  metadata:
  name: this
  spec:
    runTriggers:
      - id: ws-NUVHA9feCXzAmPHx
      - name: target-workspace
  ```

  Please refer to the [CRDs](../config/crd/bases) and [API Reference](./api-reference.md) to see if the feature you use supports `ID` or `Name`.

## Workspace Controller

- **Can a single deployment of the Operator manage the Workspaces of different Organizations?**

  Yes. The Workspace resource has mandatory fields `spec.organization` and `spec.token`. The Operator manages workspaces based on these credentials.

- **Where can I find Workspace outputs?**

  Non-sensitive outputs will be saved in a ConfigMap. Sensitive outputs will be saved in a Secret. In both cases, the name of the corresponding Kubernetes resource will be generated automatically and has the following pattern: `<metadata.name>-outputs`.

- **What version of Terraform is utilized in the Workplace?**

  If the `spec.terraformVersion` is configured, the Operator ensures that the specified version will be utilized.

  If the `spec.terraformVersion` is not configured, i.e. empty, the latest available Terraform version will be picked up during the Workspace creation and the same version will be utilized till it gets updated via the Workspace manifest.

  Regardless of the scenario, you can always refer to `status.terraformVersion` to determine the version of Terraform being used in the Workplace.

## Module Controller

- **Where can I find Module outputs?**

  Non-sensitive outputs will be saved in a ConfigMap. Sensitive outputs will be saved in a Secret. In both cases, the name of the corresponding Kubernetes object will be generated automatically and has the following pattern: `<metadata.name>-module-outputs`. When the underlying workspace is managed by the operator, all outputs will be duplicated in the corresponding ConfigMap or Secret.

- **Can I execute a new Run without changing any Workspace or Module attributes?**

  Yes. There is a special attribute `spec.restartedAt` that you need to update in order to trigger a new Run execution. For example:

  ```console
  $ kubectl patch module <NAME> --type=merge --patch '{"spec": {"restartedAt": "'`date -u -Iseconds`'"}}'
  ```

## Agent Pool Controller

- **Where can I find Agent tokens?**

  The Agent tokens are sensitive and will be saved in a Secret. The name of the Secret object will be generated automatically and has the following pattern: `<metadata.name>-agent-pool`.

- **Does the Operator restore tokens if I delete the whole Secret containing the Agent Tokens or a single token from it?**

  No. You will have to update the Custom Resource to re-create tokens.

- **What will happen if I delete an Agent Pool Customer Resource?**

  The Agent Pool controller will delete Agent Pool from Terraform Cloud, as well as the Kubernetes Secret that stores the Agent Tokens that were generated for this pool.
