## Development Environment

1. Create an API token that you are going to use for development

    We strongly advise creating a separate account, organization, and API token for development purposes. A free [Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io/) account is more than enough for that purpose. Follow the steps in the [Usage guide](./docs/usage.md#prerequisites) to get more information on how to generate a token and keep it in the Kubernetes Secret.

1. Install Go

    Install the version of [Golang](https://golang.org/) as indicated in the [`go.mod`](./go.mod) file.

1. Clone this repo

    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cloud-operator.git
    $ cd terraform-cloud-operator
    ```

1. Prepare a Kubernetes cluster

    While our preference is to use [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) for setting up a Kubernetes cluster for development and test purposes, feel free to opt for the solution that best suits your preferences.

1. Install CRDs into the Kubernetes cluster

    ```console
    $ make install
    ```

1. Run the Operator on your cluster

    ```console
    $ make run
    ```

    In this scenario, all outputs will be displayed in the console. You should be able to see an output similar to this:

    ```console
    INFO	Starting EventSource	{"controller": "workspace", "controllerGroup": "app.terraform.io", "controllerKind": "Workspace", "source": "kind source: *v1alpha2.Workspace"}
    INFO	Starting Controller	{"controller": "workspace", "controllerGroup": "app.terraform.io", "controllerKind": "Workspace"}
    INFO	Starting EventSource	{"controller": "agentpool", "controllerGroup": "app.terraform.io", "controllerKind": "AgentPool", "source": "kind source: *v1alpha2.AgentPool"}
    INFO	Starting Controller	{"controller": "agentpool", "controllerGroup": "app.terraform.io", "controllerKind": "AgentPool"}
    INFO	Starting EventSource	{"controller": "module", "controllerGroup": "app.terraform.io", "controllerKind": "Module", "source": "kind source: *v1alpha2.Module"}
    INFO	Starting Controller	{"controller": "module", "controllerGroup": "app.terraform.io", "controllerKind": "Module"}
    INFO	Starting workers	{"controller": "agentpool", "controllerGroup": "app.terraform.io", "controllerKind": "AgentPool", "worker count": 1}
    INFO	Starting workers	{"controller": "workspace", "controllerGroup": "app.terraform.io", "controllerKind": "Workspace", "worker count": 1}
    INFO	Starting workers	{"controller": "module", "controllerGroup": "app.terraform.io", "controllerKind": "Module", "worker count": 1}
    ```

Congratulations! You're all set to start working on your change!

## Make changes

### Apply changes

There are two main pieces of the Operator `API` and `Controller`. Depending on which part you are working on, you need to perform pass different sets of targets to the `make` command:

- API:

    Once you made changes in the API codebase(`/api/**`), you need to re-generate CRDs and re-run the Operator to apply them. Press `Ctrl+C` in the console where you have it running, generate new CRDs, install them and run again. It is all can be done in one command:

    ```console
    $ make generate manifests install run
    ```

- Controller:

    Once you made changes in the controllers codebase(`/controllers/**`), you need to re-run the Operator to apply them. Press `Ctrl+C` in the console where you have it running and run again:

    ```console
    $ make run
    ```
    
    For simplicity, you can always run the full set of targets to re-run the Operator regardless of the changes you have made:

    ```console
    $ make generate manifests install run
    ```

### Test changes

- API:

    If your made API-related changes(`/api/**`), please make sure you have updated the tests and always run them:

    ```console
    $ make test-api
    ```
    
- Controllers:

    We rely on (Ginkgo)[https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo] testing framework in our controllers E2E tests. If your made controller-related changes(/controllers/**), please make sure you have updated the tests and always run them.

    Export the organization name and API token to environment variable:

    ```console
    export TFC_TOKEN=<YOUR_API_TOKEN>
    export TFC_ORG=<YOUR_ORG_NAME>
    ```

    Run tests:

    ```console
    $ make test
    ```
    
    In all other cases, please follow the rules:

    - Always run tests before and after your changes.

    - Write tests to cover your changes.

    Every test should be executable through a make target, and the target should have a prefix of "test-".
