> **Warning**
> In upcoming releases, we shall proceed with renaming this project to HCP Terraform Operator for Kubernetes or simply HCP Terraform Operator. This measure is necessary in response to the recent announcement of [The Infrastructure Cloud](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/introducing-the-infrastructure-cloud).
>
> The most noticeable change you can expect in version 2.6.0 is the renaming of this repository and related resources, such as the Helm chart and Docker Hub names.
>
> Please follow the changelogs for updates.

Kubernetes Operator allows managing HCP Terraform / Terraform Enterprise resources via Kubernetes Custom Resources.

> **Note**
> _From this point forward, the terms HCP Terraform can be used interchangeably with Terraform Enterprise in all documents, provided that the contrary is indicated._

The Operator can manage the following types of resources:

- `AgentPool` manages [HCP Terraform Agent Pools](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/agents/agent-pools), [HCP Terraform Agent Tokens](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#agent-api-tokens) and can perform TFC agent scaling
- `Module` implements [API-driven Run Workflows](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/run/api)
- `Project` manages [HCP Terraform Projects](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/organize-workspaces-with-projects)
- `Workspace` manages [HCP Terraform Workspaces](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the Operator there are a number of ways how to troubleshoot it:

- check the Operator logs:

    ```console
    $ kubectl logs -f <POD_NAME>
    ```

    Logs for a specific CR can be identified with the following pattern:

    ```json
    {"<KIND>": "<NAMESPACE>/<METADATA.NAME>", "msg": "..."}
    ```

    For example:

    ```text
    2023-01-05T12:11:31Z INFO Agent Pool Controller	{"agentpool": "default/this", "msg": "successfully reconcilied agent pool"}
    ```

- check the CR:

    ```console
    $ kubectl get agentpool <NAME>
    $ kubectl get module <NAME>
    $ kubectl get project <NAME>
    $ kubectl get workspace <NAME>
    ```

- check the CR events:

    ```console
    $ kubectl describe agentpool <NAME>
    $ kubectl describe module <NAME>
    $ kubectl describe project <NAME>
    $ kubectl describe workspace <NAME>
    ```
